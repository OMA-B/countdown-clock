# countdown-clock

This is quite some project to build my knowledge on how to:

~ make some calculation of time

~ use and manipulate the Date Object 

~ manipulate the calendar (date input) to not show some dates

~ make a video background

~ use localStorage to store objects

and so many more

I've arranged the files and codes in such a way that you wouldn't find difficulty navigating through and understanding...

But if get muzzled at any point, you can always reach out to me on any of my social media platform(links' on my profile)...

I hope you like it, and if find it helpful/useful, kindly give a star and leave a follow. Thank you.

Would love to receive your feedback as well, so kindly reach out.
